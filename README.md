## App Screens

The app contains 3 main screens accessible via bottom navigation:

1. **Settings** - Configure the Google Sheets CSV URLs for Master sheet (customer list) and Ledger sheet (ledger data)
2. **Customers** - View and search customer information from the Master sheet. Click on any customer to view their ledger
3. **Ledger Search** - Search for customer ledgers directly by entering a customer number

## Setup

1. **Configure Google Sheets CSV URLs**:
   - Open your Google Sheet containing ledger data
   - Go to **File → Share → Publish to web**
   - **Important**: Select the specific sheet to publish (Master or Ledger), not the entire document
   - Select **CSV** format
   - Click **Publish** and copy the generated link
   - Repeat for each sheet you need to publish
   
2. **In the app's Settings page, configure both URLs**:
   - **Master Sheet URL**: The CSV link for your customer list (Master sheet)
   - **Ledger Sheet URL**: The CSV link for your ledger data (Ledger sheet)

3. **Search for Ledger**:
   - Use the **Ledger Search** tab to enter a customer number directly (e.g., "1033", "1035", "1139B", "1525")
   - Or use the **Customers** tab to browse and click on a customer to view their ledger
   - Data is fetched fresh from Google Drive on each search
